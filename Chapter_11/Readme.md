The Ruby 'gets' method stops runtime and waits for user input and return the
input plus enter as the value.
  From research: The gets method returns a string type line of data from the info it gathered 
  from keyboard's keystrokes.

The Ruby 'chomp' method takes off the enter from the 'gets' value so just
the value is returns
  From research: the enter value chomp is removing is "/n"

It seems gets.chomp is mainly used for asking the user questions. The results
then can be used in if statements or while loops to choose the direction / results
of the program.
