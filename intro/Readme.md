Questions:
What are the three most essential skills that a beginner programmer needs to know?

1.  Reading and Writing
2.  Attention to Detail
3.  Spotting Differences

Please explain these three skills in your own words.

1.  Reading and Writing: Reading provides different perspectives and is one form of access to experts' knowledge.
    Writing or typing verses copy and paste forces you to slow down to understand what is being learned or  
    implemented and for it to sink in.
2.  Attention to detail: By paying attention to how and what you are implementing, future problems can be avoided. With
    a good attention to detail process, a future problem possibility will be caught beforehand.
3.  Spotting Differences: By being good at spotting differences, it will better the chances the code will be well formatted 
    and adhere to convention.

Why do you need to not copy and paste?

If you copy and paste some code, it will most likely not sink in. This is a missed opportunity for solving a future
problem where you might have been able to relate that code, to come up with a solution.
