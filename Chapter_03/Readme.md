Floating Point Number:

It is of the ruby Float Class. It differs from an integer because integers are whole 
numbers and float has places after the decimal. If you want a number to be of the Float 
Class then there needs to be at least one number before and after the decimal. 

Example:

Float: 0.0
Integer: 0
