# add the string class variables together to print as

# this just is polite use of the terminal, try removing it
# starts the next prompt on the next line in the terminal

Mistakes I made:

- typing spaces when I shouldn't or not typing spaces when needed

- caught myself predicting what will be typed next and typed without looking at the example, it 
  didn't cause an error but probably not a good habit to get into
