1. refer to my_ex6.rb
2.y = "Those who know #{binary} and those who #{do_not}."
  puts "I said: #{x}." 
  puts "I also said: '#{y}'." 
3. He wasn't lying
4. Adding two strings together results in combining the two strings thus creating a longer string.

I like the flow of string interpolation better than format strings. Also with string interpolation, you 
have already chosen the format of the variable, so you only have to change or select a format, if you 
want it to result in a different format than the original.

rubocop offenses:

- Useless assignment to variable
  * left alone to follow exercise
- Literal interpolation detected.
  x = "There are #{10} types of people."
    * left alone to follow the exercise
