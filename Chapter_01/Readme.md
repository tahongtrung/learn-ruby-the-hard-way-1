The offenses were fixed by changing the double quotes to 
single quotes for the strings that didn't have single quotes 
inside them. This action was chosen because
it is convention to use single quotes if double quotes 
aren't required, like when using string interpolation.
I changed the strings back after the offenses were fixed to
match the exercise in Learn Ruby the Hard Way, to stay with 
convention.
