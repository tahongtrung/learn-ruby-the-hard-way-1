In the .rb 'file ex4.rb' on line 8 the program couldn't define the variable 'car_pool_capacity'.
Since the author was using two local variables to define the variable 'car_pool_capacity' he might have misspelled one 
of the local variables he was using, to calculate the value, to assign to the 'car_pool_capacity' variable. If the local 
variable is misspelled it won't pull the intended value or will error out.

4.0 is used instead of 4 because it is the float class where just 4 is the integer class. Using floats during 
calculations will provide more accurate results. For example when using ruby 3.0 / 2 will equal 1.5 where 3 / 2
the result will be less accurately 1.
